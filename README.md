# CalMeme v1.0
A fun Chrome extension built for people wishing to relate to the popular meme culture at UC Berkeley. 

## About 
This simple extension works by replacing popularly used keywords to meme-like texts on webpages. 

## Usage

I intend to publish this public repository as a verified extension on the Chrome Web Store for people to download directly without any additional hassle. However, to currently download the extension, you might need to have [Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01) enabled on your Chrome browser. 

To start off, you can start by typing [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) on your Chrome browser. 

Toggle the **Developer Mode** switch on the top right-hand corner. 

Alternatively, you could click the Chrome menu icon ![](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/hotdogmenu.png) and select **Extensions** from the **Tools** menu. Ensure that you toggle the **Developer Mode**  switch on the top right-hand corner. 

Clone the repository using 

```bash 
git clone https://www.github.com/agamjolly/CalMeme.git
```

Unzip the file using an extraction software. [WinZip](https://www.winzip.com), [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7zip](https://www.7zip.com) work the best on Windows. Alternatively Unix users could use the following commands: 

```bash 
cd <path to directory> 
```
to change directory to the path where the file has been cloned and 
```bash
unzip calmeme_extension.zip -d <path to destination folder>
```
to unzip the file to the destination.

On the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page, click on '**Load Unpacked**' option on the left-hand side of the extensions panel. 

Choose the path to where you unzipped the extension in the previous step.

***Voila!*** Your extension is all loaded and you're good to go.
